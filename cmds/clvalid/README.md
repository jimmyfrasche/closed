usage: clvalid [flags] [importPath] Type
  -func
        Create a function instead of a method
  -name string
        The name to use for the func/method
  -o filename
        The filename to output
  -tags build tags
        a list of build tags to consider satisfied during the build. For more information about build tags, see the description of build constraints in the documentation for
the go/build package

usage notes:
        * importPath is only allowed if Type is not defined in current package.
        * if the type is from a different package or cannot have methods, -func is implicit.
        * -name defaults to 'legal' for methods and 'legal<Type>' for funcs.
        * If -o is not provided it defaults to f_clvalid.go, where f is the name of the file containing the declaration for Type.
